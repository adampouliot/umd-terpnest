TerpNest is a free tool built by students, for students.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates real apartment listings near UMD
- Calculates **walking distance** to your school (Engineering, Business, Journalism, etc.)
- Lets you filter by **price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage**
- Allows you to download results as a CSV file

**No more checking 10+ websites**. No more guessing how far you'll be walking in the rain.

**Get started below and find your next place to live. It's totally free.**
